# The Possum Project

## Goal
Our goal is to make a pet for students who are not allowed to have any. It will not behave reasonably if you don't care for it. You must give him rewards and punish him to control his actions. You can interact with him in various ways that will affect him differently. 

PS. PP might eat his own poo and get ill if you don't train him.
